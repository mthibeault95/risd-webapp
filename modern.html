  <p>Distorted Circle within a Polygon II is one in a series of works Mangold made in the early 1970s that create a tension between two basic geometric forms: the line painted on the picture plane and the shaped canvas that forms the work’s ground and structure. The conflict between these opposing shapes is tempered by use of flat, muted color, in this instance a grayish-green. Mangold’s work differed from other Minimalist practice of the 1960s and 1970s in his emphasis on subtle irregularities—note the distortion of this circle, within an irregular polygon. These differences imbue his work with a more “human” quality.</p><p><button class="button" data-open="paintingone">info</button></p>

          <p>This painting is characteristic of Bridget Riley’s exploration of how color and simple geometric forms combine to create particular optical effects. The measured variation of blue, ochre, orange, teal, brown, and white stripes suggests a pattern that never seems to materialize, prompting us to appreciate the harmony of the colors while we try to determine the system that brings them together.

Riley is strongly identified with 1960s Op Art, which explored the ability of abstract painting and sculpture to affect the viewer visually and psychologically. In Gather and her subsequent works, Riley uses pattern and color in a more nuanced way than the more dazzling, effects-driven work associated with the Op Art movement.</p><p><button class="button" data-open="paintingtwo">info</button></p>

          <p>This work presents abstract fields of light and dark colors to evoke the atmosphere of the boat-docking site alluded to in the title. (Blue and green areas give a sense of the meeting of water and land, while black masses and lines variously connote shadows or the edges of docks or boats.)

Mitchell painted Mooring soon after she settled in Vétheuil, France, a town on the River Seine where impressionist Claude Monet often worked. Known as one of Mitchell’s “Territory” paintings because of its exploration of a particular place, this work is distinguished by its interplay of textures, ranging from dense impasto to thinly painted areas.</p><p><button class="button" data-open="paintingthree">info</button></p>

          <p>No. 18 comprises rectangles that vary just enough, on close scrutiny, to become distinguishable bands of black and deep blue. The use of color fields and the seeming absence of brushstrokes create an effect that encourages intense visual concentration. Reinhardt’s statement that “there is a black which is old and black which is fresh … lustrous black and dull black, black in sunlight and black in shadow” is exemplified by No. 18’s presentation of different shades of color, leading us towards a deeper consideration of tone, affect, and how we perceive the world.

          <p>The subject and title of this painting derive from the artist’s interpretation of a shadow cast by a telephone pole. The work also evokes the more general notion of opposite poles, with a compositional emphasis at the top and bottom. The white areas represent the pole, and the black indicates the shadow. The expansive white shapes, which seem to go beyond the limits of the canvas, highlight the clean borders between elements. Characteristic of the style known as hard-edge painting, this work emphasizes flatness and intentionally avoids the effect of spatial relationships between forms.

          <p>Primary Hue creates an optical illusion of nested squares in differing shades of red, yet only a single color underlies the radiating lines. The lines alternate green and blue as they travel from the center to the painting’s edge, causing a seeming transformation in the red background.

Anuszkiewicz is identified with the Op Art movement of the 1960s and 1970s, as was Bridget Riley. That movement emphasized the abstract use of geometric forms to develop dynamic, visually deceptive compositions.

          <p>Here, white crayon applied on gray oil paint creates layers of scrawls reminiscent of chalk on a school chalkboard. These rhythmic scribbles suggest both the development of a narrative and a record of the artist’s gestural performance.

Twombly’s experience as a cryptologist in the U.S. Army prompted a fascination with drawing and calligraphy that is evident in Untitled and other works from his Blackboard series of paintings created between 1967 and 1971.

          <p>If you are only moved by color relationships, then you miss the point. I’m interested in expressing the big emotions—tragedy, ecstasy, doom.* –Mark Rothko

Soft-edged rectangles glow and dissipate, hovering over this deeply saturated red canvas. Rothko explored variants of this composition for more than two decades, staining, blotting, and layering paint with delicate brushstrokes to build expanses of atmospheric color. Purely abstract, lacking hard lines, and with no identifiable narrative content, this work expresses the artist’s profound concern with the spiritual, symbolic qualities of color.

          <p>I think that people have much better access to the deeper meaning of things if we stop verbalizing and overly describing things with words. –Agnieszka Brzeżańska

This painting features intersecting arcs and fields in differing shades of blue, gray, and white. Brzeżańska evokes a wide range of forms, from the treble-clef music symbol to shifting cloud patterns. The work reflects the performative nature of its production, both in the movement implied by the painted gestures on the canvas, and its use of abstract imagery as a form of communication.
